# sdmi-ortho-control

This archive provides the control and checkpoints used in the aerotriangulation (control points) and quality control (checkpoints) of [SDMI orthomosaic](http://alaskamapped.org/ortho) image tiles produced in support of the [Statewide Digital Mapping Initiative (SDMI)](http://alaskamapped.org/sdmi) statewide mapping effort.

The point features in this dataset were collected or surveyed by Quantum Spatial and the map documents and organization of this dataset was provided by UAF GINA.

This control dataset is a component of the SDMI orthomosiac project that received funding in a partnership between the State of Alaska and the Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) of the US Department of Interior and US Fish and Wildlife. The overall project management, provision of control and DEMs, and quality assurance was conducted by Quantum Spatial. Source imagery for the orthomosaic was the SPOT5 satellite was provided by Astrium. Orthomosaic image processing, orthorectification, and mosaiking was performed by Fugro Earthdata. UAF-GINA oversaw the State of Alaska's management of the contract, final QA/QC, data services and distribution.

## Contents of this SDMI Ortho Control bundle

This sdmi control bundle contains the following:
  * seperate source database files (MDB) for control and checkpoints provided by Quantum Spatial for the SDMI Ortho project
  * two sets of shapefiles (SHP) generated from contained database files, tailored for use in either ARCMAP or QGIS
  * ARC Map Document (MXD) displaying control/checkpoint shapefiles as well as the current publicly available SDMI Orthoimage basemap, (provided as a Web Mapping Service).
  * QGIS document (QGS) displaying control/checkpoint shapefiles as well as the current publicly available SDMI Orthoimage basemap, (provided as a Web Mapping Service).
  * this README.md
  
### SDMI Ortho Web Mapping Service

The orthoimage mosaik referenced in this dataset was differentially rectified using aerotriangulation results and elevation data to produce map products with a horizontal spatial resolution equal to 2.5 meter per pixel. They are available in three seperate renderings:
  * CIR: 24 bit false color-infrared
  * RGB: 24 bit simulated natural color
  * PAN: 8 bit panchromatic - greyscale of the RGB
  
These products are licensed for use by the US public sector and academia at no cost and may be accessed through the AlaskaMapped portal at http://wms.alaskamapped.org/ortho. 
Further details concerning the EULA can be found at http://alaskamapped.org/public_docs/sdmi-ortho-eula.pdf

Use of this Data

----------------

The data in this bundle has been conveniently designed to intuitively operate within the two contained map documents.
In order to view this data, simply open one of the two documents using ARCMAP, (for .mxd file), or QGIS, (.qgs file).
That's it! It's all in there.
