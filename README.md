# sdmi-ortho-control
This is a README file for the archived control and checkpoints used in the aerotriangulation (control points) and quality control (checkpoints) of ortho image tiles produced in support of the Statewide Digital Mapping Initiative (SDMI).

Overview of SDMI

The SDMI is a cooperative state program endorsed by the Governor and implemented by the University of Alaska (UA) and State of Alaska Departments of Natural Resources (DNR); Military and Veteranâ€™s Affairs (DMVA); Public Transportation and Public Facility (DOTPF); Environmental Conservation (DEC); Fish and Game (DFG); and Commerce, Community, and Economic Development (DCCED).

The SDMI works in partnership with Federal, local, industry and non-profit partners. To date, that partnership has come primarily in the form of the contribution of imagery and elevation data for Alaska valued at more than $10 million. Please see the list of data contributors for a more detailed look at our generous partners.

Contents of this dataset

-----------------------

This sdmi control bundle contains the following:
  * seperate source database files (MDB) for control and checkpoints provided by Quantum Spatial for the SDMI Ortho project
  * two sets of shapefiles (SHP) generated from contained database files, tailored for use in either ARCMAP or QGIS
  * ARC Map Document (MXD) displaying control/checkpoint shapefiles as well as the current publicly available SDMI Orthoimage basemap, (provided as a Web Mapping Service).
  * QGIS document (QGS) displaying control/checkpoint shapefiles as well as the current publicly available SDMI Orthoimage basemap, (provided as a Web Mapping Service).
  * this README.md
  
SDMI Ortho Web Mapping Service

The orthoimage mosaik referenced in this dataset was differentially rectified using aerotriangulation results and elevation data to produce map products with a horizontal spatial resolution equal to 2.5 meter per pixel. They are available in three seperate renderings:
  * CIR: 24 bit false color-infrared
  * RGB: 24 bit simulated natural color
  * PAN: 8 bit panchromatic - greyscale of the RGB
  
These products are licensed for use by the US public sector and academia at no cost and may be accessed through the AlaskaMapped portal at http://wms.alaskamapped.org/ortho. 
Further details concerning the EULA can be found at http://alaskamapped.org/public_docs/sdmi-ortho-eula.pdf


Use of this Data

----------------

The data in this bundle has been conveniently designed to intuitively operate within the two contained map documents.
In order to view this data, simply open one of the two documents using ARCMAP, (for .mxd file), or QGIS, (.qgs file).
That's it! It's all in there.
